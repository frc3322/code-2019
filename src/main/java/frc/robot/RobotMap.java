          (If any of this seems too difficult or too stupid to implement, talk to either Colt or Fish about it)
        
        
        Auto-Alime Procedure:
          
          While button is held AND LimeLight can find targets:
            Robot automatically and continuously alimes based on LimeLight input
            Driver 1 still has Left/Right control, but their input is mixed with the algorithm’s input
            Driver 1 still has full control over Forward/Backward, but speed is reduced
          
          While button is held AND LimeLight cannot find targets:
            Driver 1’s controller rumbles
            Driver 1 has full control over the drivetrain
            Full speed in maintained
        
        
        Intake Procedure:
        
          Once button is pressed:
            Lift goes to bottom
            Outtake motors start
            Intake motors start
            Intake pneumatics extend
          
          Driver 2 can still toggle the intake pneumatics at will
          
          Once cargo is detected OR Button is pressed again:
            Outtake motors stop
            Intake motors stop
            Intake pneumatics retract
